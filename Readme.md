# Hash Attack Experiment

This project explores the difficulty of two classic hash function attacks:

- **Collision Attack**: Finding two different inputs that produce the same hash.
- **Preimage Attack**: Finding an input that produces a specific hash.

The project demonstrates how the number of attempts needed for these attacks grows as the hash size increases.

## Experiment Setup

- **Languages used**
  - C# (.NET 8.0) — main experiment code
  - Python — data visualization (box-and-whisker plots)

- **Process**
  1. The C# console application (`Program.Main`) runs trials for both attacks.
  2. Each attack type has a `RunTrial` method in `ExperimentRunner.cs`.
  3. For each bit size tested, 50 samples are generated per trial.
  4. Results are written to CSV files (`collision_results_trial_*.csv`, `preimage_results_trial_*.csv`).
  5. A Python script (`plot_results.py`) loads the CSV files and produces graphs.

## Theoretical Expectations

- **Collision Attack**: Expected attempts ≈ 2^(n/2)
- **Preimage Attack**: Expected attempts ≈ 2^n

Where `n` is the bit size of the hash.

## Results

The data collected confirms that:
- Collision attacks scale with ~2^(n/2).
- Preimage attacks scale with ~2^n.
- Box-and-whisker plots show averages, variation, and expected values.
- Some outliers appear due to randomness, but overall trends match theory.

Example plots (generated by Python):
- `collision_plot.png`
- `preimage_plot.png`
