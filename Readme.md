# Hash Attack Experiment

This project explores the difficulty of two classic hash function attacks:

- **Collision Attack**: Finding two different inputs that produce the same hash.
- **Preimage Attack**: Finding an input that produces a specific hash.

The project demonstrates how the number of attempts needed for these attacks grows as the hash size increases.

## Experiment Setup

- **Languages used**
  - C# (.NET 8.0) — main experiment code
  - Python — data visualization (box-and-whisker plots)

- **Process**
  1. The C# console application (`Program.Main`) runs trials for both attacks.
  2. Each attack type has a `RunTrial` method in `ExperimentRunner.cs`.
  3. For each bit size tested, 50 samples are generated per trial.
  4. Results are written to CSV files (`collision_results_trial_*.csv`, `preimage_results_trial_*.csv`).
  5. A Python script (`plotHashExperiments.py`) loads the CSV files and produces graphs.

## Theoretical Expectations

- **Collision Attack**: Expected attempts ≈ 2^(n/2)
- **Preimage Attack**: Expected attempts ≈ 2^n

Where `n` is the bit size of the hash.

## Results

The data collected confirms that:
- Collision attacks scale with ~2^(n/2).
- Preimage attacks scale with ~2^n.
- Box-and-whisker plots show averages, variation, and expected values.
- Some outliers appear due to randomness, but overall trends match theory.

Example plots (generated by Python):
- `collision_plot.png`
- `preimage_plot.png`

## File Structure

### Build Instructions

The `HashAttack` Console Project is the one needed to compile and execute.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Command-line terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt on Windows; bash/zsh on Linux)
- Python 3.x with libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy (for plotting)

### Project Setup and Execution Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
gitbash->

git clone https://github.com/aston70/Project-Hash-Attack.git
cd Project-Hash-Attack
```

### 2. Build the project
Build commands  
Once built, executable files should reside in:

Windows:  .\HashAttack\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64  
Linux:    .\HashAttack\bin\Release\net8.0\linux-x64  

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project HashAttack\
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true
```

Linux - Detailed Example (Powershell):
Build Single file - recommended

### 3. Publish the project for Linux

This puts a single executable file in the immediate publish folder.
```bash
dotnet publish ".\HashAttack\HashAttack.csproj" `
  -c Release `
  -r linux-x64 `
  --self-contained true `
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true `
  -p:PublishTrimmed=true `
  -o ".\publish"
```

### 4. Transfer files to Linux Lab Machine and execute, if needed

```bash
scp ".\publish\HashAttack" dsmith78@mscs6.eecs.utk.edu:~/
scp ".\Plotting\plotHashExperiments.py" dsmith78@mscs6.eecs.utk.edu:~/
```

### 5. Execute the program on Linux

Make executable
```bash
chmod +x HashAttack
```

Execute
```bash
./HashAttack
```

Console output example:
```bash
dsmith78:mscs6 ~> ./HashAttack
Starting Trial 1 for Collision Attacks...
=== Collision trials: 8 bits ===

Collision Progress: 20/400
Collision Progress: 30/400
Collision Progress: 40/400
Collision Progress: 50/400
=== Collision trials: 10 bits ===
Collision Progress: 60/400
...

```

### 6. View results

```bash

python3 -m ensurepip --user
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --user pandas matplotlib numpy

python3 plotHashExperiments.py

```
Plots are saved as `.png` files in your working directory.
